 I'm the Chair of the Division of Social Studies at Parami University, a liberal arts university in Myanmar that is partnered with Bard College. Iâ€™m also an honorary postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Sociology at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.

My research looks at coloniality, development, international education, governmentality, and neoliberalism. It has appeared in *Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education*, *Postcolonial Studies*, *Journal of Peace Education*, and elsewhere. I also review manuscripts for journals such as *Critical Studies in Education*, *Television and New Media*, and *Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies*.

Previously, I taught at public and private universities in Sri Lanka. I have also worked as a human rights observer in Mexico and Guatemala.
