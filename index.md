Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Education and Social Justice at Lancaster University. My research looks at decolonial theory, development, international education, governmentality, and neoliberalism.

My articles have appeared in *Postcolonial Studies*, *Journal of Peace Education*, *animation: an interdisciplinary journal*, and elsewhere. I also review manuscripts for Routledge, *Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies*, and the *Journal of International and Comparative Education*.

I recently completed five years of teaching development, sociology, and peace studies at public and private universities in Sri Lanka. Previously, I worked as a human rights observer in Mexico and Guatemala.
