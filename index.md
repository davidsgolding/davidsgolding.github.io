I'm a researcher in Chicago. My research looks at decolonial theory, development, international education, governmentality, and neoliberalism.

My articles have appeared in *Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education*, *Postcolonial Studies*, *Journal of Peace Education*, and elsewhere. I also review manuscripts for journals, including *Critical Studies in Education*, *Television and New Media*, and *Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies*.

I recently completed five years of teaching development geography, international relations, sociology, and peace studies at public and private universities in Sri Lanka. Previously, I worked as a human rights observer in Mexico and Guatemala.
