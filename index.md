Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Education and Social Justice at Lancaster University. My research looks at decolonial theory, development, international education, governmentality, neoliberalism, and cultural theory.

My articles have appeared in _Postcolonial Studies_, _animation: an interdisciplinary journal_, _Journal of Peace Education_, and elsewhere. I also review book proposals for Routledge and papers for Journal of International and Comparative Education.

I recently completed five years of teaching development, sociology, and peace studies at public and private universities in Sri Lanka. Previously, I worked as a human rights observer in Mexico and Guatemala.
